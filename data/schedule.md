## 1
Write down our model and make analysis in Jupyter NoteBook.
We plan to use three models, *Logistic Regression*, *KNN* and *Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)*.
We are going to compare these three models.

## 2.
Improve our code. We are going to use SQL, Plotly etc. into our code.


## 3.
Create an Web App. The patient can input their information into our APP and choose which method she would like to predict.
And our APP will give the patient a probability that she may get a breast cancer.
