## What our app does and what its limitations
1. First of all, this App is created for the patients who has potential breast cancer. So, if you are not the appropriate person, this App is only just for fun. Before you use it, you should understand the function of it. The App is created to predict one person has breast cancer or not.
2. Secondly, our App needs four detail information of the patient, so that our App can give them a prediction. If one of these information was lacked, it will return error.
3. Thirdly, the App will not go into medical field. Even though our prediction has very high accuracy, it still doesn't mean 100% correct. So, if one patient really want to test whether she got breast cancer or not. We highly recommend her to go to hospital instead of using our App. And we won't be responsible for the test result.
4. Last but not least, our App may has some bias. Because all the data is collected comes from United States. So, if you are the patients who come from Aisa, Africa, Europe etc. The prediction may be incorrect. 

If you fully understand the potential disadvantages of our App and accept the potential danger, I think you can use our WebApp right now. Good Luck and have fun.
